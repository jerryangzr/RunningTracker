# RunningTracker
This application is a Java-based Android mobile running tracker that aims to track usersâ€™ real-time movement when doing different exercises and storing their data for further feature usage. 
A real-time map and exercise data are shown by logging the change in a physical location using GPS. Users can inspect and annotate their data when they finish their exercises. 
Useful performance statistics analysis will be provided for each exercise as well.

A detailed description of the project can be found [here](doc/RunningTracker_description.pdf).
